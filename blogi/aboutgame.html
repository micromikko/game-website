						<p>
							On the Right Side of Wrong (OTRSOW) is a text-driven, noir inspired murder mystery where the player assumes the role of P. Steele, a "hard-boiled" private eye. Our story takes place in an unnamed city that has fallen on some hard times. Crime runs rampant, morality is forgotten and common decency has been curve stomped and left to die on the street.
						<p/>
						<br />
						<p>
							Steele gets tipped off by one of his old cop buddies that a case ruled as a suicide might hold more to it. The police aren't going to investigate any further; so it falls to Steele to get to the bottom of the case. 
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>Features:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Text-driven, (loosely) noir inspired adventure.</li>
							<li>Awe inspiring hi-fi sound effects and music.</li>
							<li>A clue list to keep tabs on what's going on and where to head next.</li>
							<li>A single store to spend your money on liquor that has no in-game effect.</li>

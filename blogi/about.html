						<p>
							Field &amp; Cabins Productions was formed by Mikko Peltola and Tuomas Hyttinen in October 2015, with the goal of creating a game for a school assignment. Only a rudimentary grasp on programming, we started out learning C# and object-oriented programming from scratch to create our project. Towards the end, we had incorporated the Unity engine to the game for UI and audio elements.
						<p/>
						<br />
						<p>
							The road was long and rocky and several mistakes were made, but in the end we managed to create what we had sought out to make.. sort of. We had to cut about 60% of our initial features and 80% of out story content due to time limits. All the while, we also had built a really convoluted game engine on top of it.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							All in all our project was a success, and if nothing more, at least we gained some newfound respect for game developers. Through our hardships, we realized even a seemingly small thing in-game can take a really long time to build, debug, or function.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							All in all the whole project was meant to introduce us to C#, OOP and the process of making games. In that it succeeded with flying colors. We both found programming really enjoyable and quite addictive. Now with our experience and newly learned skills, we're ready to jump on to an all new project to challenge ourselves.
